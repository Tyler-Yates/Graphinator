Graphinator
===========

Graphinator is an easy-to-use visual learning tool for graphs. Users are able to create vertices on a blank canvas and then connect these vertices to examine various aspects of graph theory such as:
 - What is the [coloring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring) of the graph?
 - What is the maximum [degree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(graph_theory)) of the graph?
 - Is the graph [bipartite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph)?
 - Is the graph a [tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory))?

Graphinator allows users to add, move, and delete both vertices and connections in real-time with all relevant graph information updated instantaneously. Users are able to save the graphs they create to disk allowing graphs to be shared between teachers and students.
